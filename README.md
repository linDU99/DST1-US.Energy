## U.S. Energy Consumptions

by Lin Ma and Vamsi Vundela 

### Purposes: 
- Visualize patterns of U.S. total energy consumptions over time, 1949-2024
    + Total end-use energy consumption
    + Total electricity consumption (end-use)
    + Energy consumptions by sector: Residential, Commercial, Industrial, and Transportation 

- Forecasting future end-use energy and electricity consumptions through 2025-2030
- State level: 

### Datasets:
- Sources:  API of U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)
- U.S.-level data: 1949 - 2024
    + EIA Open Data, Total Energy & indicators: www.eia.gov/opendata/
- State-level data: 2000 - 2023
    + State Energy Data System (SEDS): www.eia.gov/opendata/browser/seds

### Directory Structure:
- data: Include the raw data files extracted and the cleaned data files for analysis
- notebooks: The Jupyter Notebook files for data cleaning, EDA exploration, and analysis
- visuals: The analysis outputs

### Main Findings:
- U.S. total end-use energy consumption and electricity use have increased as rising in GDP and population from 1949 to 2024.
- Intensity indicators: 'Energy use per GDP' and 'energy use per capita', which indicate energy efficiency has improved substantially, especially since 1980.
